~Approach: The given function checks if two strings, s and t, are anagrams. An anagram means both strings contain the same characters with the same frequencies, but possibly in a different order. The function sorts both strings and then compares them character by character.

~Algorithm Used:

1. Sorting: Both strings are sorted in ascending order using std::sort.

2. Comparison: After sorting, the function checks if both strings are identical by comparing each character in a loop.

3. Final Check: If both strings are of equal length and every character matches, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

~Time Complexity:

1. Sorting takes O(n log n) (where n is the length of the string).

2. The comparison loop takes O(n) in the worst case.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n log n) + O(n) â‰ˆ O(n log n).
