~Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-operations-to-make-all-elements-divisible-by-three/description/

~Approach: The problem requires counting elements in the array that are not divisible by 3. The approach involves iterating through the array and checking each elementâ€™s divisibility. If an element is not divisible by 3, it is counted towards the result.

~Algorithm:

1. Initialize a counter left_no to 0.
2. Iterate through the array.
3. For each element, check if it is not divisible by 3.
4. If true, increment left_no.

Return left_no as the final result.

~Time Complexity:

The algorithm performs a single pass through the array, checking each element individually. Since each check is an O(1) operation, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array.
