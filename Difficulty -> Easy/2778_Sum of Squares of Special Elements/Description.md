~Approach: The function calculates the sum of squares of specific elements in the given array nums. It considers only those elements whose 1-based index is a divisor of the array size.

~Algorithm:
1. Determine the size a of the array.
2. Initialize sum to 0.
3. Iterate from 1 to a, checking if i is a divisor of a.
4. If i is a divisor, add the square of nums[i-1] to sum.

Return the final computed sum.

~Time Complexity:

The algorithm iterates from 1 to a, checking divisibility, which takes O(a) time in the worst case. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of nums.
